# Space Potato
## A Portal 2 Quote-along Project
## [See it now!](http://elsamoluf.github.io/)

### Summary
This project is a way to quote along with lines from the video game [Portal 2](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/). Lines from characters are provided simultaneously in audio and text formats. Loosely inspired by [Chell in the Rain](http://sorrowind.net/vilify/).

This project is for Portal fans or anyone with an appreciation for absurd statements completely out of context.

### Outline
My intention is to delve more into JavaScript functionality and design while also learning how to incorporate a jQuery plugin.

This project uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and the  [jPlayer](https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer) plugin. I'll be using object-oriented design principles.

After selecting a character users can press to hear a randomly provided audio clip. The words are also displayed in staggered timing.
